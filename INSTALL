                hashkat-lib Installation Instructions

Building and installing the hashkat-lib library

    Using the same procedrue below you can build hashkat-lib for 
    Linux/Windows/OS X:

    1. Clone from repository:

    $ git clone https://github.com/arminms/hashkat-lib.git

    2. Create a build directory

    The recommended way to build the library is in a seperate build
    directory, for example within the top-level of the hashkat-lib
    package:
    $ cd hashkat-lib
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build

    3. Configure the library

    $ cmake ..

    The latter command will try to locate the necessary libraries. If
    everything is OK, then this should end with something like:
    -- Generating done
    -- Build files have been written to: some-path/hashkat-lib/build

    To build a multi-threaded version of hashkat, which uses multiple threads
    for handling concurrent actions, you need a thread-enabled boost
    library and Intel® Threading Building Blocks (Intel® TBB). By default,
    CMake 2.6 will only search for a thread-enabled boost installation, while
    CMake 2.4 will fall-back to a non-multithreaded boost library.

    Most linux distributions provide multi-threaded boost libraries and 
    Intel® TBB by default now.

    If CMake fails, because it cannot resolve all dependencies, then you
    may help CMake by setting some variables to help CMake locate the
    libraries. This may be done on the command-line using -Dvar=value or
    using the interactive program:
    $ ccmake .

    Note that multi-threaded version is OFF by default. Variables that you
    may set to configure multithreaded version  are:

    CONCURRENT
        It is OFF by default. By changing it to ON other variables will
        appear.

    TRY_FINDING_INTEL_TBB
        Tries to find Intel® TBB. If it couldn't find it in system
        directories, it tries to find it at $HOME/tbb44_20150728oss.
        You can download the latest version of Intel® TBB for various
        plateforms from https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/download.

    [g].

    4. Build the binaries

    $ make

    5. Install hashkat binaries (as user with sufficient permissions):

    $ make install

    This will install hashkat and hashkat_mt to $INSTALL_PREFIX/bin. The
    later (i.e. hashkat_mt) is multi-threaded version.
