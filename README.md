Hashkat version 2 (#k@-v2) - Kinetic Analysis of Twitter-like networks
===

A tool and source base for simulations that are designed to mimic the events that occur in social simulations such as Twitter. These events include following, tweeting, retweeting, unfollowing, and agent creation. Agents in our simulations represent users, and the simulation simulates their connections and the information they spread.

This is the new code base for #k@ network simulation software that supports both single and multithreaded runs.
