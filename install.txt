Hashkat-v2 Installation Instructions
====================================

    Using the same procedrue below you can build #k@-v2 for 
    Linux/Windows/OS X:

    1. Clone from repository:

        $ git clone https://github.com/arminms/hashkat-v2.git

    2. Create a build directory

       The recommended way to build the library is in a seperate build
       directory, for example within the top-level of the #k@-v2
       package:

        $ cd hashkat-v2
        $ mkdir build
        $ cd build

    3. Configure the library

        $ cmake ..

       or run GUI version (recommended for Windows):

        $ cmake-gui ..

       The latter command will try to locate the necessary libraries. If
       everything is OK, then this should end with something like:

        -- Generating done
        -- Build files have been written to: some-path/hashkat-v2/build

       To build a multi-threaded version of hashkat, which uses multiple threads
       for handling concurrent actions, you need a thread-enabled boost
       library and Intel® Threading Building Blocks (Intel® TBB).

       Most linux distributions provide multi-threaded boost libraries and 
       Intel® TBB by default now.

       If CMake fails, because it cannot resolve all dependencies, then you
       may help CMake by setting some variables to help CMake locate the
       libraries. This may be done on the command-line using -Dvar=value or
       using the interactive program:

        $ ccmake .

       Note that multi-threaded version is OFF by default. Variables that you
       may set to configure multithreaded version are:

       CONCURRENT
        It is OFF by default. By changing it to ON other variables may
        appear (e.g. FIND_INTEL_TBB).

       FIND_INTEL_TBB
        Tries to find Intel® TBB. If it couldn't find it in system
        directories, it tries to find it at $HOME/tbb44_20160413oss
        (C:\local\tbb44_20160413oss on Windows plateform). You can download
        the latest version of Intel® TBB for various plateforms from
        https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/download.

       [g].

    4. Build the binaries

        $ make

       For parallel builds add '-j N', e.g. for building using 4 CPUs use:

        $ make -j 4

       On Windows using native tools (i.e. Visual Studio) use cmake build
       facility:

        $ cmake --build . --config Release

       and for multi-thread builds use:

        $ cmake --build . --config Release -- //m

    5. Running tests (optional):

        $ make
        $ make test

       And on Windows:

        $ cmake --build . --config Release --target run_tests

    6. Install hashkat binaries (as user with sufficient permissions):

        $ make install

       And on Windows:

        $ cmake --build . --config Release --target install

       This will install hashkat and hashkat_mt to $INSTALL_PREFIX/bin. The
       later (i.e. hashkat_mt) is the multi-threaded version.

    7. Making CPack install packages (optional):

        $ make package

       And on Windows with NSIS installed:

        $ cmake --build . --config Release --target package
