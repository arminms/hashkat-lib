Hashkat Version 2 (#k@-v2) -- Kinetic Analysis of Twitter-like Network
======================================================================

This is the new codebase for #k@ network simulation software that
supports both single and multithreaded runs.

#k@ is a tool and codebase for simulations that are designed to mimic
the events that occur in social simulations such as Twitter. These
events include following, tweeting, retweeting, unfollowing, and agent
creation. Agents in our simulations represent users, and the simulation
simulates their connections and the information they spread.
